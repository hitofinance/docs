# Liquid Staking Token - hHYPE

The hHYPE token represents a sophisticated financial instrument that enables token holders to maintain liquidity while participating in the staking mechanism. This innovative solution provides users with the ability to earn staking rewards without compromising the flexibility of their assets.

hHYPE tokens serve as a fundamental component of the HYPE ecosystem, facilitating seamless integration with various DeFi protocols while maintaining exposure to staking rewards.

## Staking Mechanism

The staking process is implemented through a streamlined interface. Token holders may stake their HYPE tokens through the designated platform interface. Upon successful staking, an equivalent amount of hHYPE tokens will be issued to the user's wallet, representing their staked position and future rewards.

## Unstaking Procedure

The unstaking process consists of two distinct phases:
1. Initiation of the unstaking request, which converts hHYPE tokens back to the underlying HYPE position
2. Execution of the withdrawal process (detailed in the following section)

Please note that rewards accumulation ceases upon initiation of the unstaking process.

## Exchange Rate

The hHYPE exchange rate($C_r$) is determined by a number of factors, including:

- The total amount of HYPE staked in the Staking Contract: $Q_{tsk}$
- The total amount of redeemed HYPE: $Q_{red}$
- The amount of staking rewards: $Q_{rew}$
- The commission ratio: $R_{com}$
- The total amount of hHYPE minted: M
- The total amount of hHYPE burned: N

In general, the exchange rate is positively correlated with the staking income, which is influenced by these variables. The exact formula for calculating the hHYPE exchange rate is as follows:

```math
C_i = \frac{[(Q_{stk} - Q_{red}) + Q_{rew} \times (1 - R_{com})]}{(M - N)}
```

Since the protocol does not implement a slashing mechanism, the exchange rate can only increase as rewards accumulate. This means that later redeemers may receive a larger amount of HYPE upon redemption compared to earlier redeemers.


## Withdrawal Protocol

The withdrawal mechanism operates according to the following principles:
* Daily processing of rewards and withdrawal requests
* Immediate withdrawal availability subject to protocol liquidity conditions
* Queue-based processing system for high-demand periods
* First-in-first-out (FIFO) processing methodology

## Reward Distribution Framework

The protocol implements a transparent reward distribution system with the following allocation:

| Stakeholder | Allocation | Calculation Methodology |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Token Holders | 90% | Total rewards minus protocol commission |
| Protocol | 10% | Operational and maintenance costs |

## Token Valuation Mechanism

hHYPE tokens function as interest-bearing instruments, with their value appreciating over time through the accumulation of staking rewards. The valuation is influenced by multiple factors:

* Total HYPE staked in the protocol
* Reward generation rate
* Protocol commission structure
* Token supply dynamics

It is important to note that the token value exhibits a positive correlation with staking rewards, ensuring that the exchange rate can only appreciate over time.

## Yield Generation

The protocol's yield generation mechanism is influenced by several key factors:
* Network participation metrics
* Total protocol stake
* Market dynamics

Token holders may monitor their staking performance and the protocol's annual percentage yield (APY) through the integrated dashboard interface.
