# Hito Finance

## From HyperLiquid to HitoFinance

Hito Finance is a premier liquid staking protocol on HyperEVM, powered by StaFi AI LSaaS and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) strategies.

With liquid staking, you can still use your tokens in DeFi protocols, such as lending and borrowing, while still earning staking rewards along with a share of MEV profits in a transparent and equitable manner. By incorporating MEV extraction into a liquid staking pool, HitoFinance enhances staking yields and ensures a fairer distribution of value across the network. In essence, HitoFinance transforms traditionally wasted or centralized MEV revenue into extra rewards for its community of stakers.

## What is mHYPE

mHYPE are a LST that represents staked HYPE assets. It is issued by the HitoFinance and can be used for trading, borrowing, or lending on various platforms.

When a user stakes their HYPE using the Staking Contract, they will receive a certain amount of mHYPE based on the amount of HYPE staked at the current exchange rate for the mHYPE. The exchange rate for the mHYPE is determined by supply and demand, and it can fluctuate over time.

As the staking rewards for the HYPE accumulate, the exchange rate for the mHYPE will increase, and the amount of HYPE that can be redeemed will also increase.
