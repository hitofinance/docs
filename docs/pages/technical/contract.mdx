# Contract

## Overview

The smart contract system consists of three main components that work together to provide liquid staking functionality:

1. **StakeManager**: The core contract that manages staking operations and validator management
2. **StakePool**: The intermediary contract that handles fund management and cross-chain operations
3. **LsdToken**: The liquid staking derivative token contract

## StakeManager

The **StakeManager** contract is the central component that oversees all staking operations. It implements several key features:

### Key Features
- Manages validator sets and their operations
- Handles staking rate calculations and updates
- Distributes staking rewards and protocol fees
- Manages era-based operations and updates
- Controls stake pool operations

### Core Functions
- `stake()`: Allows users to stake tokens and receive LSD tokens in return
- `unstake()`: Enables users to unstake their LSD tokens
- `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw their unstaked tokens
- `newEra()`: Updates the staking era and calculates new rates
- `addValidator()`/`rmValidator()`: Manages validator sets
- `startRedelegate()`: Handles validator redelegation

### Security Features
- Implements upgradeable proxy pattern (UUPS)
- Uses role-based access control
- Includes rate limiting and validation checks
- Implements emergency functions for critical situations

## StakePool

The **StakePool** contract acts as an intermediary between stakers and the staking program, handling:

### Key Features
- Manages cross-chain operations
- Handles delegation and undelegation of tokens
- Tracks pending operations and balances
- Implements settlement and redelegation processes

### Core Functions
- `delegate()`: Delegates tokens to validators
- `undelegate()`: Undelegates tokens from validators
- `startSettle()`: Initiates settlement process
- `startRedelegate()`: Handles redelegation between validators
- `withdrawForStaker()`: Processes withdrawals for stakers

### State Management
- Tracks total pending delegations and undelegations
- Manages settlement and redelegation statuses
- Maintains spot balance and delegation information
- Handles cross-chain bridge operations

## LsdToken

The **LsdToken** contract represents the liquid staking derivative token with the following features:

### Key Features
- Implements ERC20 standard with burnable functionality
- Tracks staked positions and rewards
- Provides rate information for staking operations
- Manages token minting and burning

### Core Functions
- `mint()`: Creates new LSD tokens (restricted to minter which is StakeManager)
- `burn()`: Burns LSD tokens
- `getRate()`: Provides current staking rate
- `updateMinter()`: Updates the minter address

### Integration
- Integrates with StakeManager for rate information
- Provides rate information to external protocols
- Maintains token supply and balance tracking

## Contract Interactions

The contracts work together in the following way:

1. Users interact with StakeManager to stake/unstake tokens
2. StakeManager coordinates with StakePool for delegation operations
3. StakePool handles cross-chain operations and validator interactions
4. LsdToken represents the staked position and can be used in DeFi applications
5. Era-based updates ensure proper rate calculations and reward distribution

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement upgradeable patterns for future improvements
- Strict access control is enforced through modifiers
- Critical operations have validation checks and error handling
- Cross-chain operations include safety checks and status tracking
- Emergency functions are available for critical situations
