# AI LSaaS

LSAAS is short for Liquid Staking As a Service, similar to the RAAR -Rollup as a service, both are a SAAS platform that facilitate the development of software. StaFi LSD Stack is a LSAAS platform that focus on building a general liquid staking platform for developers.

## What is StaFi

StaFi is a leading Liquid Staking infrastructure provider and protocol for PoS chains. Its Liquid Staking as a Service (LSaaS) framework enables developers to create Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs) across ecosystems like ETH, EVM, BTC, Cosmos, TON, and SOL. By issuing rTokens (e.g., rETH, rMATIC, rBNB), StaFi unlocks the liquidity of staked assets, allowing users to earn staking rewards while retaining the flexibility to engage in DeFi. With support for major blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Cosmos, StaFi bridges liquidity and security in Proof-of-Stake networks.

## What is LSaaS

LSaaS is a paradigm shift offering developers a robust framework to build their own Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs). Compared to Rollup as a Service(RaaS), RaaS projects, like Altlayer, Dymension and Conduit, are primarily concerned with improving blockchain scalability and efficiency through layer 2 solutions.

## LSaaS Stack

The LSaaS is developed by abstracting technology from current solutions in the LSD industry while integrating cutting-edge innovations to create a decentralized staking network. A single LST accumulates security from the framework validated by existing LSD projects, ensuring upgradability to stay aligned with industry advancements.

The Stack is divided into two parts:

- Standard Stack: Includes essential functions such as staking, unstaking, and reward updates.
- Modular: Provides advanced features beyond the basics, including interoperability and DeFi integration, requiring further development.

The primary objective of this Stack is to simplify stakingâ€”allowing users to stake and receive an LST or unstake and retrieve their original tokens easily. Additionally, the framework fosters meaningful DeFi adoption by leveraging the LST Stack.

LSaaS Components:

- ETH LST Stack
- EVM LST Stack
- EigenLayer LRT Stack
- Babylon LST Stack
- Karak LRT Stack
- Cosmos LST Stack
- Solana LST Stack
- TON LST Stack
- StaFi AI Agent

Modular App Store:

- Point Module
- CCIP Module
- ZK Module
- AI Module
- Everclear Module
- Blink Module

## Hito Finance LST

Hito Finance LST is built on top of the EVM LSD Stack, leveraging AI to assist with code development and testing. This has significantly reduced the time and effort required for the StaFi team to launch new LSTs.
