# Architecture

Hito Finance's hHYPE Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) system is built on top of the EVM LSD Stack from StaFi's AI-powered LSaaS. The system enables users to stake their HYPE tokens and receive hHYPE tokens in return, which represent their staked position and rewards.

## Components

### Contracts
The Hito Finance system comprises several smart contracts that facilitate the staking and unstaking processes. The **StakeManager** contract oversees the overall staking operations, including rate calculations, validator management, and commission distribution. The **StakePool** contract acts as an intermediary, managing the funds between stakers and the HYPE staking program, handling delegation, undelegation, and cross-chain operations. The **LsdToken** contract represents the liquid staking derivative token, tracking staked positions and rewards, and enabling its use in various DeFi applications. Together, these contracts ensure a secure and efficient staking experience for users.

### Relay Service
The Relay Service is designed to be permissionless, allowing anyone to trigger the necessary contract functions. This ensures that the system remains decentralized and does not rely on a single entity to maintain its operations.

### User Application

The User Application is the interface through which users interact with the Hito Finance staking system. It provides a seamless experience for staking and unstaking operations, allowing users to earn rewards efficiently.

## Stake Flow

Users can stake their HYPE tokens through the `stake` method and receive equivalent hHYPE tokens in return. The amount of hHYPE tokens received is calculated based on the current rate:

```
hHYPE Amount = Stake Amount * Total hHYPE / Escrow HYPE
```

Where:
- `hHYPE Amount` is the amount of hHYPE tokens being minted to the staker
- `Stake Amount` is the amount of HYPE tokens being staked
- `Total hHYPE` is the total amount of hHYPE tokens minted and distributed to users
- `Escrow HYPE` is the total amount of HYPE tokens staked and locked in the LSD system

## Unstake Flow

hHYPE holders can call the `unstake` method to exchange their hHYPE tokens back for HYPE tokens. The process involves:

1. Burning hHYPE tokens
2. Initiating undelegation process
3. Waiting for the unbonding period
4. Withdrawing HYPE tokens

## Withdraw Flow

Users can withdraw their staked HYPE tokens and rewards by calling the `withdraw` method after the unbonding period has elapsed.

## Relay Service

Due to smart contract limitations, the system introduces a Relay service that:

1. Triggers the StakeManager at regular intervals
2. Collects and calculates user rewards
3. Distributes rewards to the platform and users
4. Updates the exchange rate between HYPE and hHYPE

## Rate Management

The system maintains a dynamic exchange rate between HYPE and hHYPE tokens that:

1. Updates based on staking rewards
2. Has rate change limits to prevent volatility
3. Is tracked per era
4. Affects the amount of hHYPE tokens minted/burned

## Era System

The system operates on an era-based schedule where:

1. Each era has a configurable duration (1-48 hours)
2. Rewards are calculated and distributed per era
3. Rate changes are tracked per era
4. Validator delegations are managed per era

## Security Features

1. **Ownership Management**: Critical functions are restricted to contract owners
2. **Rate Limits**: Prevents extreme rate changes
3. **Validator Management**: Controlled validator addition/removal
4. **Emergency Functions**: Available for critical situations
5. **Cross-chain Security**: Secure bridge operations between L1 and EVM
